# 🎉 Countdown to Birthday App

A simple and interactive web app that counts down to your next birthday! Built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it calculates the time left in **days, hours, and seconds**, updating in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- 🗓️ Prompt-based input for Date of Birth in `DD MM YYYY` format.
- ⏳ Real-time countdown to your **next birthday**.
- 🔁 Automatically adjusts the year if the birthday has already passed this year.
- ⚡ Live updates every second using `setInterval()`.
- 📱 Responsive and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

- **HTML** – for the structure of the app.
- **Tailwind CSS** – for responsive and clean styling.
- **JavaScript** – to calculate and display the countdown logic.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the HTML file.
2. **Open the HTML file in a browser.**
3. You'll be prompted to **enter your Date of Birth** in the format `DD MM YYYY`.
4. The countdown to your next birthday will be displayed and updated in real time.


> 💡 Tip: Make sure your HTML file is opened in a browser that supports JavaScript prompts for best experience.
