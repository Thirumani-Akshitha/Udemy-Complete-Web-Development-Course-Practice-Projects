Hey everyone! 👋

Welcome to Day 4 of my Web Development learning Challenge!

fron Today I have started learning JavaScript and built a basic program:

🧠 Karel Robot Project – Beeper Zigzag Pattern

I'm currently running this Karel code on the Karel Online IDE (https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/karel/ide.html) to practice decomposition and movement logic using functions in Karel’s language. 🖥️🤖

🔍 What the Code Does
This program instructs Karel the Robot to create a zigzag pattern of beepers across a grid. The actions follow a structured pattern of movement and beeper placement across three rows.

🧠 How It Works
The program moves Karel in a zigzag fashion across 3 rows, placing beepers at specific intervals.

1. beepersRight() places 3 beepers while moving right.
2. goUpTurnLeft() and goUpTurnRight() help Karel change rows and direction.
3. beepersLeft() places beepers while Karel moves to the left.
4. This pattern repeats across three levels to create a simple zigzag of beepers.

🛠 How to Run

1. Go to the Karel Online IDE.
2. Paste the full code above into the editor.
3. Ensure Karel starts at the bottom-left of the world (1st Street, 1st Avenue), facing East.

Having so much fun through this learning, Excited to continue my learning.
