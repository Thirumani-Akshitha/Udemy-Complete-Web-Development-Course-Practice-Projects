# ðŸš€ Day 26 â€“ Navigation Bar with React & React Router

This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. On Day 26, I built a **functional navigation bar** using **React** and **React Router DOM** to simulate routing between pages in a web application.

---

## ðŸ”§ What I Worked On

- Created a clean top navigation bar using `Link` components
- Routed between multiple pages using `Routes` and `Route`
- Designed a simple layout using `App.css`
- Used `BrowserRouter` to wrap the application in a routing context

---

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to maintain a consistent UI across multiple pages
- Styling active navigation links for a better user experience
- The importance of organizing components for scalable code
- How React Router handles client-side navigation

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React
- React Router DOM
- CSS (App.css)
