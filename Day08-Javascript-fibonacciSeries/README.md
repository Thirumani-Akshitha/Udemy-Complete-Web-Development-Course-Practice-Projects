Day 8 - Web Development Challenge 🚀

What I Learned 📚:
1. Practiced solving the Fibonacci Sequence problem using JavaScript.
2. Strengthened my skills with for loops, arrays, and conditional logic.
3. Also learned about using a while loop for similar tasks.

Project Completed 🛠️:
1. Built a Fibonacci Sequence Generator function that returns the Fibonacci series based on user input.
2. Successfully handled different cases and dynamically generated the sequence.
3. Gained confidence in breaking down problems into small logical steps!

How to Access and Run the Code 🔥:
1. The code is saved in the same folder as a file named code.js.
2. Open the code.js file in any code editor (like VS Code, Sublime, etc.).

Reflection ✨
This may seem like a small project, but it's a big step in building my confidence and problem-solving ability.
Excited to keep moving forward and learn more complex topics!
