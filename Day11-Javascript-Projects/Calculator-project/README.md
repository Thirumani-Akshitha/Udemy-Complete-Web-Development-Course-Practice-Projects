# ðŸ§® JavaScript Calculator

A simple yet functional calculator built as a mini-project to practice **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic UI styling**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of:
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Handling user inputs and events
- Creating a responsive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## âœ¨ Features
1. Performs basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
2. Clean layout using HTML & CSS
3. Real-time display update with button inputs
4. Error handling for invalid expressions


## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Day11-javascript-projects/Calculator-project` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
- Deepened understanding of how JavaScript can control UI behavior dynamically.
- Reinforced concepts like `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and DOM traversal.
- Improved structuring of JS logic for interactive interfaces.
