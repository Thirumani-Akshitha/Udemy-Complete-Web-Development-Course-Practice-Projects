# ðŸŽ¨ Background Color Changer

A fun mini-project built to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation. This project changes the background color of the webpage to a random color from a predefined list when a button is clicked.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project was part of my JavaScript DOM learning journey. It helped reinforce:
- Selecting elements using `querySelector`
- Handling button click events
- Changing styles dynamically with JavaScript

## âœ¨ Features

1. A clean UI with a button and color display.
2. Randomly changes the background color on each click.
3. Displays the current background color as text.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- JavaScript event handling using `addEventListener`.
- Using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` for generating random values.
- Real-time DOM updates with `textContent` and `style`.
