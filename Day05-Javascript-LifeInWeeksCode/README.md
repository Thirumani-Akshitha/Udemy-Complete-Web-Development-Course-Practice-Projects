Today, I completed the "Life in Weeks" coding exercise! hashtag#Javascript

 This simple yet powerful challenge reminded me how valuable our time is — and gave me more practice in JavaScript fundamentals like functions, variables, arithmetic, and console.log formatting.

✅ Passed all test cases!
✅ Learned the importance of precision in output formatting.

Every small step is building towards bigger skills. 🚀
