💻 Day 7 – Web Dev Challenge

✅ What I Did:
- Practiced JavaScript **arrays** with `.push()` and `.pop()`
- Completed two mini-projects:
  - **FizzBuzz** – Logic-based array builder
  - **Who’s Paying** – Picks a random person from a list

🧠 What I Learned:
- Working with arrays and indexes
- Using `Math.random()` for random selection
- Writing clean, formatted return values

🚀 Feeling:
Really enjoyed today’s hands-on practice! These small wins are keeping me motivated and excited to keep learning web development.

▶️ How to Run:
You can run these JavaScript programs:
- In the browser console (right-click → Inspect → Console)
- Or using any online JS playground like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or [Replit](https://replit.com/)

Next Up:
I’ll keep exploring more array methods like .splice(), .slice(), and start looping through arrays using for and while loops.
