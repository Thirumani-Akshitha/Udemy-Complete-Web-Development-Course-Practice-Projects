# Day 10 - Web Development Challenge 🚀

Today, I completed a **Virtual Drum Kit** project using JavaScript DOM Manipulation!

## What I practiced:
1. Adding `eventListeners` to multiple elements in a loop.
2. Handling both **Mouse Clicks** and **Keyboard Presses**.
3. Playing different sounds based on key/button pressed using `switch` statement.
4. Adding and removing CSS classes dynamically for button animations.

## Project Details:
- **Project Name:** Virtual Drum Kit 🥁
- **Main Files:**  
  1. `index.html` — Basic structure  
  2. `DOMpractice.js` — JavaScript logic  
  3. `sounds/` — Folder with drum sound files

## How to run:
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Make sure the `sounds/` folder is present in the same location.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
4. Click on the drum buttons or press the keys `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l` to play sounds!


Every small project like this is boosting my confidence and JavaScript skills! ✨
